our company has a new strategic initiative to increase market penetration maximize brand loyalty and enhancing tangible assets in pursuit of these objectives we started new projects which require seven red lines I understand your company can help us in this matter of course 
border hit will be the project manager will so we can do this calmly yes of course Anderson here is our expert in all matters related to drawing red lines we've put him on today's show his professional opinion nice to meet you well you all know me this is Justin how companies design specialist hello we need you to draw seven red lines all of them strictly perpendicular some with cleaning and some transparent can you do that 
no I'm afraid not Russian any hasty nonsense in the Tuscan seven needs to be carried out the end of the day our next 
the term redlined implies the color of the line to be read to draw a red line with green ink is well if it's not exactly possible it's pretty close to being impossible what does that even mean impossible 
I mean it is possible that some people say suffering from color blindness for whom the color blind says really make a difference but I'm quite sure that the target audience of your project doesn't consist solely of such people this is possible 
I'll simplify line as such can be drawn with absolutely anything but if you want to get a red line you need to use reading 
what we drove in with blue ink 
still won't work if you use blink you'll get two lines 
and what exactly did you mean when you talk about the transparency in how to explain 
I'm sure you know transparent means yes I do and what a red line means I hope I don't need to explain to you what you need to draw a red line 
with transparent ink 
your describe what you mentioned the end result would look like come on and see what we got hit kindergarten 
let's not waste our time with these unproductive quarrels the Tuskers been set the task is plain and clear now if you have any specific questions and go ahead you're the expert here 
alright let's leave aside the color for the moment you had something that also relating to perpendicular to seven lines all stripped the perpendicular to what 
%HESITATION 
to 
everything amongst themselves I do not want to live a life because he does he's an expert 
two lines can be perpendicular all seven can be simultaneously perpendicular to each other 
hello I'll tell you if 
this is our line right 
yes and another is it perpendicular to the first line 
well 
it yes it is preventative exactly the wait wait I'm not done and a third one is it open the killer to the first line 
yes it is but it doesn't cross the second line they're both Hera 
not perpendicular 
I suppose so there is two lines 
in 
how about this 
this is a triangle 
it's definitely not perpendicular lines and that's three not seven 
why they blew it determines what's that myself 
I have a blue pen with me you distress intensified smoke problem your lines of blue draw them with red ink it won't solve the problem but how do you know if we've tried that strolled with magic than that see I I don't have a pen with me but I'm completely certain that with reading the result will still be the same didn't you tell us earlier you could only draw red lines with red ink if I discovered that down here and knows what to do with blue ink that you want us to call these red lines 
I understand you're not you're not talking about the color now right you're talking about that %HESITATION but what what do you call it %HESITATION Dick Dick 
yeah that's it now you confused everyone so what exactly is stopping us from doing this 
German tree just ignore it we have a tusk seven red lines it's not twenty is just seven Anderson I understand you're a specialist in our field you don't see the overall picture but surely it's not a difficult task to draw some seven line exactly suggest a solution that any fool can criticize no offense but don't expect you should know better 
okay 
let me draw you to perfectly perpendicular red lights and I will draw out the rest with transparent ink do be invisible but I'll draw them with this you just 
yes this was the death yes but at least a couple with greeting %HESITATION and and I have another question if I may ask can you tell one of the lines in the form of a kitten %HESITATION what in the form of a kitten market research tells us all uses like cute animals it would be really great if we 
why look I can of course are you a cat %HESITATION notice I can give it a try but it will be a live anymore it'll be attached to the line of the cat these are two different things 
not a cat but the kitten the little cute cuddly cats on the other hand dissonant least route she hasn't even finished speaking in Urdu saying no I got the idea but it's impossible to draw a line in the form of a cat good what about a bud 
so where do we stop what we're doing at seven red lines at two with red ink to be drinking the rest with transparent financing correctly yes excellence in which case that's everything right I almost forgot we also have a red blue do you know if you could inflate 
what do I have to do with balloons it's red Anderson can you or can you not do this a simple question as such I can't of course but excellence organize a business trip will cover the expenses go over to that location 
inflate the balloon 
well this is very productive thank you all 
can I ask you one more question please 
when you inflate the balloon could you do it in the form of a kitten 
of course I can I can do anything I can do absolutely anything 
I'm an expert
