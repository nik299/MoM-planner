okay 
okay 
okay so because today of the meeting is to discuss of all our new markets because I do know 
I will go down let's see you can see from the graph almost daily keep going going off every day from January two thousand seven until October so I think it may if you record the line expand our market what do you think about this 
I think we should expand our market expanding to overseas so that we can get more customers and can make a lot of money that is really nice but even like 
lake view overseas countries should be laid export our products us on the phone with you and see how we might explode into some country in the world class and he led me to the bar to ready or after the analytic that a studio in new season and over three great expense and put back into circulation actually glad that China Korea Japan that is really nice idea to the import all products to U. S. or European country lay you came because I'd be annoyed at a different date released resealable having pesky and bought four Asian countries like China Korean sports event I don't think so because they they they want to have white ski you be like explore or expand our market data do not get on top of the mall over laying dead beat this song strongly believe in that posture that we should have a voice team today your view being you would blacks and things so yeah 
okay so we're more apt to your market targeted 
as you know %HESITATION Montessori focused on %HESITATION thirty to forty minutes should be laid looking for a new target 
this is the only time 
hello 
thirty two forty eight okay the system because of all the families along with seventeen to twenty to seventy two 
it's becoming in the fall and what people only in the sense ski 
you too a lot of people okay I really like the idea later you will focus on the whole whole whole customers and looking for new customers thank you but I'm not sure that the young it may seventeen to twenty two 
do they have I need to file because as you know okay it's a quiet actually yeah yeah absolutely she could %HESITATION protesting the mass market investors can set the price 
he said he could be a little meter high price I need to access 
we have to set a price to be more cheaper and affordable for those who are students %HESITATION and %HESITATION and %HESITATION are like Reagan who have blanket information comparable and they seem to do so we have more like proceed to hand it to close off the company okay yes I have a few issues right I think that we should create a small side because some people might want to try to be followed by a brief one to wait on the phone and he 
nice idea for you okay we will still go to the lake 
we should be doing investors because I will market expanded into additional so I would like to ideal we should be open and masters 
in my opinion anything at 
because she has a basketball 
the fast and hassle me fan so I think this is the best 
S. absolutely agree with you we have a question kapten ski ask you very famous so he had a lot of fans so maybe they're friendly that is crazy the outlook predicts phony did tell us that we because she's single and she can create a brand new 
receive ladies 
to test me and possibility all three of Taylor swift is also okay but the problem is it may be selling Teske in our manifesto should be like half that can speak to this is the yeah she's quite popular but you don't you don't have played Boston to showing the best email 
yeah as far as I know she's kind genuine and honest see she is %HESITATION online and find a teenager 
she has a lot of folders on her Instagram so anything else hurt easily scandal on the young and to try and put it 
okay the Israeli ninety point to be caught cutting into its lead I don't the young he 
yeah in 
for me A. six S. smart guy the same as his visa has expired and so I think he said our laws that is really nice idea required I am not having my dad but I think the guys can be those prisons are often Penske law that you have there T. person in all of my nonstick efforts 
and Kylie yeah we have now okay we'll talk this in the next meeting mmhm cut to the last five okay before that could you tell me if you go beyond the ten minutes okay okay 
I don't know who later introduced all connected a new market the promotion that we can grab our customer tension in my opinion I think that leads us into the room sorry to the new target so we should we should give a single product to people violent protests and be able to induce a discount for people who buy more than five thousand 
okay I agree with you that the gift or sample cortex and there's more picky but I'd I don't agree with that when the person this copy quite a few because I love to all wheel company 
excuse me to this topic 
and we have a long way since fifteen minutes to %HESITATION Indies okay okay what I would would like since mid June they somehow what V. have thought today would be agree or disagree with this meetings to make understanding to ease of use 
all right so we have to talk about exporting elephants protecting your countries the United States and Germany Australia and Philippines as far as I can make it no we focus on working it right now we try to focus on the new rules which is teenager and now he also shared our premium products to mess with that because the mass market easy easy for us to get into it and reveals that our price is cheaper than before so the next investor what would you like it we we consider it in the next meeting and finally I'm a new promotion is that lead to give products and %HESITATION and washer customers okay did I have any question 
okay thank you for today
